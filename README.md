## Description
Php-webdriver library is PHP language binding for Selenium WebDriver, which allows you to control web browsers from PHP.

This library is compatible with Selenium server version 2.x, 3.x and 4.x.

The library supports [JsonWireProtocol](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol) and also
implements **experimental support** of [W3C WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html).
The W3C WebDriver support is not yet full-featured, however it should allow to control Firefox via Geckodriver and new
versions of Chrome and Chromedriver with just a slight limitations.

The concepts of this library are very similar to the "official" Java, .NET, Python and Ruby bindings from the
[Selenium project](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/).

## Installation

Installation is possible using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

If you don't already use Composer, you can download the `composer.phar` binary:

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then install the library:

    php composer.phar require facebook/webdriver

## Getting started

### Start Server

The required server is the `selenium-server-standalone-#.jar` file provided here: http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

Download and run the server by **replacing #** with the current server version. Keep in mind **you must have Java 8+ installed to run this command**.

    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-#.jar

### Create a Browser Session

When creating a browser session, be sure to pass the url of your running server.

```php
// This would be the url of the host running the server-standalone.jar
$host = 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub'; // this is the default url and port where Selenium server starts
```

##### Launch Chrome

Install latest Chrome and [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

The `chromedriver` binary must be placed in system `PATH` directory, otherwise you must provide the path when starting Selenium server
(eg. `java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="/path/to/chromedriver" -jar selenium-server-standalone-#.jar`).

```php
$driver = RemoteWebDriver::create($host, DesiredCapabilities::chrome());
```

##### Launch Firefox

Install latest Firefox and [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).

The `geckodriver` binary must be placed in system `PATH` directory, otherwise you must provide the path when starting Selenium server
(eg. `java -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver="/path/to/geckodriver" -jar selenium-server-standalone-#.jar`).


```php
$driver = RemoteWebDriver::create($host, DesiredCapabilities::firefox());
```

### Customize Desired Capabilities

```php
$desiredCapabilities = DesiredCapabilities::firefox();
$desiredCapabilities->setCapability('acceptSslCerts', false);
$driver = RemoteWebDriver::create($host, $desiredCapabilities);
```

* See https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities for more details.

**NOTE:** Above snippets are not intended to be a working example by simply copy-pasting. See [example.php](example.php) for working example.

## More information

Some how-tos are provided right here in [our GitHub wiki](https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/wiki).

## Testing framework integration

To take advantage of automatized testing you may want to integrate php-webdriver to your testing framework.
There are some projects already providing this:

- [Steward](https://github.com/lmc-eu/steward) integrates php-webdriver directly to [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/), and provides parallelization
- [Codeception](http://codeception.com) testing framework provides BDD-layer on top of php-webdriver in its [WebDriver module](http://codeception.com/docs/modules/WebDriver)
- You can also check out this [blogpost](http://codeception.com/11-12-2013/working-with-phpunit-and-selenium-webdriver.html) + [demo project](https://github.com/DavertMik/php-webdriver-demo), describing simple [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) integration
